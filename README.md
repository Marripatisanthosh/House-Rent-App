Role-based access control.
• Property Listings:
rental details.
Create, update, and delete property listings with images, descriptions, and
• Search and Filter:
Advanced search functionality based on location, rent range, and property type.
• User Dashboard:
Landlords: View and manage property listings and tenant inquiries.
Tenants: Track inquiries and view saved properties.
• Inquiry Management:
Tenants can send inquiries directly to landlords.
Landlords can manage and respond to inquiries.
• Responsive Design:
Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
• Database Management:
MongoDB stores user information, property details, and messages securely.
• Deployment:
The application is deployed on Vercel for frontend and backend hosting.
• Goals:

3. Architecture
Frontend Architecture
Technology: React.js
Component-Based Design:
• The frontend is structured using React components for modularity and reusability.
o Core Components:
▪ Header & Footer: Navigation and branding.
▪ Home Page: Displays featured properties and search functionality.
▪ Property Details Page: Detailed view of a selected property with
images, description, and contact options.
▪ Dashboard: User-specific functionalities such as managing listings
(landlords) or inquiries (tenants).
• State Management:
o React Context API is used to manage global state (e.g., user authentication
status).
o Local state is handled within individual components for UI interactions.
• Routing:
o React Router manages navigation across pages, enabling dynamic content
loading without full-page refresh.
• Styling:
o CSS Frameworks: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI design.
o Custom CSS is used for specific components.
Backend Architecture
Technology: Node.js and Express.js
• Server-Side Framework:
o Express.js handles HTTP requests and defines API routes.
o Middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.
• API Endpoints:
o User Authentication:
▪ POST /api/auth/register - User registration.
▪ POST /api/auth/login - User login with JWT token generation.
o Property Management:
▪ GET /api/properties - Fetch all properties.
▪ POST /api/properties - Add a new property (landlord role).
▪ PUT /api/properties/:id - Update property details.
▪ DELETE /api/properties/:id - Remove a property.
o Inquiries:
▪ POST /api/inquiries - Submit an inquiry.
▪ GET /api/inquiries/:userId - Fetch inquiries for a specific
user.
• Authentication & Security:
o JWT (JSON Web Token) ensures secure access to protected routes.
o Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
• Database Schema & Interactions
Technology: MongoDB
Database Design:
The database uses a NoSQL structure with collections for users, properties, and
inquiries.
User Schema:
{
"_id": ObjectId,
"name": String,
"email": String,
"password": String (hashed),
"role": String ("landlord" or "tenant"),
"createdAt": Date,
"updatedAt": Date
}
Property Schema:
{
"_id": ObjectId,
"title": String,
"description": String,
"price": Number,
"location": String,
"images": [String],
"owner": ObjectId (ref: User),
"createdAt": Date,
"updatedAt": Date
}
Inquiry Schema:
{
"_id": ObjectId,
"propertyId": ObjectId (ref: Property),
"senderId": ObjectId (ref: User),
"message": String,
"createdAt": Date
}
• Database Interactions:
Mongoose ORM is used for schema definition and database operations.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed through
Mongoose methods.
• Data Security:
• Password Hashing: Passwords are stored securely using bcrypt
hashing.
• Data Validation: Data is validated on both frontend and backend to
ensure data integrity and prevent SQL injection or other attacks.
4. Setup Instructions

8. Authentication:
• Role-Based Access: Users are assigned roles (tenant or landlord), and role-based
middleware ensures only authorized users can perform certain actions (e.g., only landlords
can add properties).
• Middleware:
• Auth Middleware:
Ensures that only authenticated users with valid tokens can access protected routes. Example:
JavaScript
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
const token = req.header("Authorization");
if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: "Access Denied" });
try {
const verified = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
req.user = verified;
next();
} catch (err) {
res.status(400).json({ message: "Invalid Token" });
}
};
• Secure Data Handling:
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. Tokens are stored on the
client side (local Storage or cookies).

10. Testing
Testing Strategy
1. Unit Testing
o Goal: Test individual components and functions.
o Tools:
▪ Jest for functions and backend routes.
▪ React Testing Library for React component interaction.
2. Integration Testing
o Goal: Ensure frontend and backend work together smoothly.
o Tools:
▪ Supertest for backend API requests.
▪ Jest to check data flow across components.
3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
o Goal: Test complete user interactions, such as login and course management.
o Tools:
▪ Cypress to simulate full user journeys and interactions.
Testing Tools
• Jest: Main tool for unit and integration tests.
• React Testing Library: Tests React components from a user perspective.
• Supertest: Simulates HTTP requests to test backend APIs.
• Cypress: Tests the entire application as a user would interact with it.
Example Tests
• Unit: Calculate course progress function.
• Integration: Confirm course enrollment updates backend and frontend.
• E2E: Login, enroll in a course, and download a completion certificate.
Running Tests
• Frontend/Backend: npm test for Jest and Supertest tests.
• E2E: npx cypress open to start Cypress for end-to-end testing.
11. Demo
• Live Link: House Rent Application
Alternatively, consider recording a short GIF or video to demonstrate key flows like:
• Logging in as a user.
• Searching for properties.
• Adding or updating a property (landlord role).
• Submitting an inquiry (tenant role).
12. Known Issues
Here are the currently identified bugs or limitations in the application:
• Authentication Errors:
o Issue: Occasional delay in JWT token validation during login.
o Impact: Users may experience delayed page transitions after logging in.
• Image Upload Limitations:
o Issue: Limited support for large file sizes during property image uploads.
o Impact: Users may need to compress images manually before uploading.
• Search Functionality:
o Issue: Filtering by multiple criteria (e.g., price + location) may not work correctly in
some cases.
o Impact: Search results might not match the user's expectations.
• Dashboard Performance:
o Issue: Dashboards with many properties or inquiries may load slowly.
o Impact: User experience may degrade for landlords with extensive listings.
• Mobile View Responsiveness:
o Issue: Some components (e.g., property cards) may not scale perfectly on smaller
screens.
o Impact: Mobile users might experience minor layout issues.
13. Future Enhancements
Here are potential features and improvements planned for future iterations of the
project:
